          <li>HTML is a simple language that uses tags to instruct web browsers on how to display text and other content.</li><li>Basic HTML tags, like `&lt;b&gt;` for bold and `&lt;i&gt;` for italic, provide fundamental text formatting capabilities.</li><li>HTML pages can be created using any text editor (e.g., Notepad) and must be saved with a `.html` file extension.</li><li>All HTML pages follow a basic structure comprising a DOCTYPE Declaration, an HTML section, a HEAD section, and a BODY section.</li><li>The DOCTYPE Declaration is the first line of an HTML page, informing the browser about the HTML version being used.</li><li>The `&lt;html&gt;` tag encloses all HTML code, marking the start and end of the document, with closing tags denoted by a slash (e.g., `&lt;/html&gt;`).</li><li>The `&lt;head&gt;` section contains metadata (information not directly visible on the page), such as the page title, author info, stylesheets, and JavaScript.</li><li>The `&lt;body&gt;` section contains all visible content displayed to the user, including text, images, links, tables, and forms.</li><li>HTML allows for the inclusion of various elements like text, images, tables, and links to other pages within a webpage.</li><li>Text within HTML can be formatted with options like bold, italicized, different font sizes, and organized into bullet points or numbered lists.</li><li>Webpages can include forms with input elements for user data entry, making them interactive.</li><li>HTML facilitates the creation of interactive webpages that can collect user data and send it to a server for processing.</li><li>The `&lt;p&gt;` tag is an essential HTML tag used to define a block of text, representing a paragraph.</li>

          <li>Storyboarding is a planning technique, evolved from film and drama, used in web design to focus on storytelling, navigation flow, and overall user experience.</li><li>Storyboards are the first step in web design planning, preceding the creation of wireframes.</li><li>Wireframes are simplified visual blueprints of a webpage layout that show space allocation, element placement, and interaction behavior without including colors, fonts, or images.</li><li>Wireframes are created during the planning phase to detect and address usability or design issues early in the development process.</li><li>Wireframes typically use basic shapes like boxes and lines to represent key website elements such as headers, navigation menus, content sections, and calls to action.</li><li>Wireframing tools like Balsamiq offer easy drag-and-drop functionality for quick prototypes, while advanced tools like Figma facilitate collaboration and can even convert designs directly into working HTML.</li><li>Wireframing tools are versatile, enabling designers to create layouts for both web and mobile platforms (iOS/Android).</li><li>A web server (e.g., Apache) is necessary to host a website, storing its HTML pages and associated files in an organized folder structure.</li><li>The planned folder structure for a website can be established during the wireframing stage to ensure better organization from the outset.</li><li>The root folder serves as the main directory for a website, and the `index.html` file automatically acts as the default homepage when no specific page is requested.</li><li>Maintaining a consistent and organized folder structure (e.g., `/images`, `/fonts`, `/js`, `/css`, `/lib`) is crucial for easier maintenance, efficient file management, and improved SEO.</li>
