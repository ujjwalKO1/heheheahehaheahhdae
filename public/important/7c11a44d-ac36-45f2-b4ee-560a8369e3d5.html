          <li>HTML is a simple language that uses tags to instruct web browsers on how to display text and other content.</li><li>Tags like `&lt;b&gt;` and `&lt;i&gt;` are fundamental for basic text formatting, such as making text bold or italicized.</li><li>HTML pages are plain text files that can be created using any text editor (e.g., Notepad) and must be saved with a `.html` extension.</li><li>All HTML documents adhere to a basic structure comprising a DOCTYPE declaration, followed by the `&lt;html&gt;` section which encapsulates `&lt;head&gt;` and `&lt;body&gt;` tags.</li><li>The DOCTYPE declaration is the very first line of an HTML page, informing the browser about the specific HTML version the document follows.</li><li>The `&lt;html&gt;` tag encloses all HTML code, marking the start and end of the entire HTML document, with closing tags using a forward slash (e.g., `&lt;/html&gt;`).</li><li>The `&lt;head&gt;` tag contains metadata—information about the page that is not directly visible to the user on the webpage itself.</li><li>Metadata within the `&lt;head&gt;` can include the page title (displayed on the browser tab), author information, links to stylesheets for styling, JavaScript for interactivity, and descriptions/keywords for search engine optimization (SEO).</li><li>The `&lt;body&gt;` tag contains all the visible content shown to the user, such as text, images, links, tables, and other interactive elements.</li><li>HTML elements represent diverse webpage content, including formatted text, images, tables, links to other pages, bullet points, numbered lists, and forms for user data entry.</li><li>HTML enables the creation of interactive webpages that can collect user data through various input elements and send it to a server for processing.</li><li>The `&lt;p&gt;` tag is an essential HTML tag specifically used to define a block of paragraph text.</li>

        <ol>
          <li>The `&lt;p&gt;` tag defines paragraphs, automatically adding line breaks, and can contain various HTML elements and styling attributes.</li><li>HTML provides six heading levels (`&lt;h1&gt;` to `&lt;h6&gt;`) to structure webpage content, with `&lt;h1&gt;` for the main title and subsequent tags for decreasing importance.</li><li>Best practice for headings is not to skip levels (e.g., use `&lt;h2&gt;` under `&lt;h1&gt;`, not `&lt;h3&gt;` directly).</li><li>Basic text formatting includes `&lt;b&gt;` for bold, `&lt;u&gt;` for underline, and `&lt;del&gt;` or `&lt;strike&gt;` for strikethrough text.</li><li>The `&lt;sub&gt;` (subscript) and `&lt;sup&gt;` (superscript) tags are used for specialized text formatting, often in scientific or mathematical content.</li><li>Hyperlinks, created with the `&lt;a&gt;` (anchor) tag, are fundamental for navigating between webpages and external resources.</li><li>The `&lt;a&gt;` tag requires the `href` attribute to specify the URL of the target page or resource.</li><li>The `&lt;img&gt;` tag is used to embed images into a webpage.</li><li>The `&lt;img&gt;` tag requires the `src` attribute to specify the location of the image file.</li><li>The `alt` attribute for `&lt;img&gt;` provides alternative text, crucial for accessibility and when an image fails to load.</li><li>Optional attributes like `width` and `height` can be used with the `&lt;img&gt;` tag to control image dimensions.</li><li>Images significantly enhance the visual appeal of webpages and help attract user attention.</li>
